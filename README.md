This analysis started with a look at the Top 10 Companies in the S&P 500 by Decade.

I started looking at the companies, attached industries/type, and reviewed the rankings decade over decade.

Original data is from https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-largest-sp-500-companies-over-time-1985-2024/

I used Gemini to give me a jumping off point for industry and then I cleaned them up to consolidate.
